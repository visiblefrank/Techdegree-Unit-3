## Form Input Validation

### Intro

Forms are encountered all over the web.  So you can probably imagine that working with forms can be a big part of a developer's job.  One of the most important parts of working with forms is validating the data entered into the form before sending it off to the server.  IF a user tries to submit empty or invalid, we need a way to prevent the form from submitting.  Here’s some lightweight practice with creating custom form input validation.  You’ll use JavaScript to listen for the form submission event, and then you'll test what the user has entered into the form to determine if the results are usable.  And if not, you 'll prevent the form from submitting and log out the results.

### Instructions

 Load the `index.html` file in Chrome and open the Chrome DevTools console.  If you don't know how to do that, please reach out in Slack.  Next, follow along with the comments in the `js/script.js` file to complete this challenge.  When you are done, the form will not submit unless the user has entered valid information.

If you get stuck or have questions, reach out to your Slack team.

Best of luck and happy coding! :)
